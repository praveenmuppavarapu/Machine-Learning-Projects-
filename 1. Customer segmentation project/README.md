# Customer Segmentation Project
In this self-initiated customer segmentation project, the main objective was to identify groups of customers with similar characteristics. The project focused on conducting an unsupervised clustering analysis using machine learning techniques on customer records from a groceries firm's database. The ultimate goal was to enhance customer segmentation strategies, enabling personalized marketing campaigns and tailored product offerings.

## Project Objectives ##
  * Identify distinct customer groups based on their shared traits and purchase behavior.
  * Improve customer targeting and personalization of marketing efforts.

## Methodologies
1. Data collection from Kaggle.
2. Performing EDA and generating Insights
