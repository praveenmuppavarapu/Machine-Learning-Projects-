# Content based recommendation engine
The objective of a content-based recommendation system is to recommend items to a user that are similar to items that the user has previously interacted with. This is done by extracting features from the items that the user has interacted with and then using these features to find other items that are similar.
The features that are extracted from the items can vary depending on the type of item. For example, for movies, the features could include the genre, the cast, the director, and the plot. For books, the features could include the genre, the author, the title, and the keywords.
Once the features have been extracted, they are used to create a vector representation of each item. This vector representation is then used to calculate the similarity between items. The items that are most similar to the items that the user has interacted with are then recommended to the user.

Our objective here is to create a content based recommendation engine using IMDB movies data set
