# Machine-Learning-Projects


# Portfolio Projects
In this portfolio, I am thrilled to present my Machine Learning projects, each representing a journey I have cherished every step of. Along this path, I have achieved excellence in problem feature engineering, feature selection, model building, and the art of deploying solutions seamlessly using Streamlit.


# 1. Quora Duplicate Question Pair Detector
Quora is a question-answering website where users can ask and answer questions on a variety of topics. However, Quora also has to deal with duplicate questions, which can be a problem for both users and the platform as a whole. Duplicate questions can make it difficult for users to find the answers they are looking for, and they can also lead to users wasting time answering questions that have already been answered.
The objective of Quora duplicate question pair detection project is to identify pairs of questions that are essentially asking the same thing. This can be done by using natural language processing techniques to extract features from the questions that can be used to measure their similarity. Once a pair of questions has been identified as duplicate, they can be merged together so that users only see one version of the question.

# 2. Customer Segmentation Analysis Project:
The objective of a customer clustering project is to identify groups of customers with similar characteristics. This can be used to improve customer segmentation, target marketing campaigns, and develop new products and services.
I will be performing an unsupervised clustering of data on the customer's records from a groceries firm's database.

# 3. Collaborative recommendation engine - Books recommendation:
It attempts to find users that have similar preferences and opinions as the input and then recommends items that they have liked to the input.

# 4. Forecasting - Walmart sales
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately forecast sales for the next year.This will be achieved by using a Time series techniques to train the model on historical sales data, as well as other relevant factors such as Temperature on the given date and CPI at that time. The model will be evaluated on its ability to predict future sales with high accuracy, and the results will be used to inform business decisions about inventory management, Resource allocation, Marketing strategies...etc.

# 5. SMS SPAM Classifier
Spam is a major problem for users. It can be time-consuming and annoying to filter out spam messages, and it can also be a security risk.
The objective of this project is to develop a spam classifier that can be used to automatically classify messages as spam or ham (not spam). This can help users to quickly and easily identify and filter out spam messages.

# 6. Content based recommendation engine
The objective of a content-based recommendation system is to recommend items to a user that are similar to items that the user has previously interacted with. This is done by extracting features from the items that the user has interacted with and then using these features to find other items that are similar. The features that are extracted from the items can vary depending on the type of item. For example, for movies, the features could include the genre, the cast, the director, and the plot. For books, the features could include the genre, the author, the title, and the keywords. Once the features have been extracted, they are used to create a vector representation of each item. This vector representation is then used to calculate the similarity between items. The items that are most similar to the items that the user has interacted with are then recommended to the user.

Our objective here is to create a content based recommendation engine using IMDB movies data set

# 7. Laptop price predictor
The objective is to develop a laptop price predictor model that can accurately predict the price of a laptop based on its features. The model will be evaluated using a variety of metrics, such as R2 score and MAE. The model will be deployed as a web application so that consumers can use it to make informed decisions about which laptop to buy.
