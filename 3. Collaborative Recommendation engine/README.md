# Collaborative Recommendation Engine - A Book recommendor system
### Introduction
The Collaborative Recommendation Engine is a machine learning-based system that takes into account the preferences and behaviors of multiple users to generate personalized book recommendations. It employs collaborative filtering algorithms to identify patterns and similarities between users' preferences, enabling the system to suggest books that other users with similar tastes have enjoyed.
### How It Works...?
1. Data Collection: The system gathers data on users' reading habits, ratings, and interactions with books.

2. Collaborative Filtering: The engine uses collaborative filtering algorithms to find users with similar interests and behavior patterns.

3. Recommendation Generation: Based on the collaborative filtering results, the engine generates personalized book recommendations for each user.
